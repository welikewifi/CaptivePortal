            <p>If you submit Personally Identifiable Information to us through the We Like WiFi Site, or We Like WiFi Service, then we use your personal information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the We Like WiFi Site and We Like WiFi Service. Any Personally Identifiable Information or status content that you voluntarily disclose on the We Like WiFi Service becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by We Like WiFi for statistical purposes. We do not use your mobile phone number or other Personally Identifiable Information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your mobile phone number (or email address, if provided) without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major We Like WiFi Site or We Like WiFi Service changes or for customer service purposes). We may use both your Personally Identifiable Information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous user usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the We Like WiFi Site and We Like WiFi Service and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing user preferences and trends. </p>

We may collect and release Personally Identifiable Information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with local and federal laws (such as UAE Copyright Law), international law or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant or equivalent, or where in our reasonable belief, an individual’s physical safety may be at risk or threatened. We Like WiFi also reserves the right to disclose Personally Identifiable Information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that We Like WiFi believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Service, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of the We Like WiFi Site or our servers, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of We Like WiFi, our users or others. </p>
            <h2>Your Choices</h2>
            <p>You may, of course, decline to submit Personally Identifiable Information through the We Like WiFi Site or the We Like WiFi Service, in which case We Like WiFi may not be able to provide certain services to you. Your continued usage of the We Like WiFi Service will signify your assent to and acceptance of our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to We Like WiFi and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, We Like WiFi makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. If We Like WiFi learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We Like WiFi may post a notice on the We Like WiFi Site or through the We Like WiFi Service if a security breach occurs. </p>
            <h2>Our Commitment To Childrens' Privacy</h2>
